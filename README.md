## Problem Statement

For years software engineers have relayed on managers and/or administrators to produce fair production support schedules.  Most schedules produced end up lacking fairness and transparency to the engineers that they serve.  Schedules usually don’t cover the following items:

* Recognition for Holidays worked
* Recognition for volunteering to help
* Explanation into how schedule was determined
* Fair distribution between primary and secondary support
* Ability for engineers to modify scheduled

To remedy the issues documented above I plan to create an application called “SUPPORT:it”  This site will put the power back into the engineers hands and use rules to determine a fair schedule that everyone can agree on.
